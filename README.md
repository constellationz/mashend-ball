# namatchi/gamebuilder
A template for building Rojo projects. Designed with both partial and full management in mind.

### Custom Loader

```lua
local Get = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Get"))

local Maps = Get.ServerAsset "Maps" -- Get maps from server storage
local Crown = Get.Asset "Props/Crown" -- Get the crown asset from common storage
local DataStore2 = Get "MyModule" -- Load DataStore2 from external repo
local ForwardData = Get.Remote "ForwardData" -- Get a common remote
```

### Straightforward Rojo structure

By default, the file tree is organized as follows:

| File tree | Roblox | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `src/client` | [StarterPlayerScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/PlayerScripts) | Client-side scripts |
| `src/server` | [ServerScriptService](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ServerScriptService) | Server-side scripts |
| `src/common` | [ReplicatedStorage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ReplicatedStorage) | Common modules, assets, and remotes |
| `src/character` | [StarterCharacterScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/StarterCharacterScripts) | Scripts placed in the character |
| `src/first` | [ReplicatedFirst](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ReplicatedFirst) | Scripts that the client should load first |
| `src/storage` | [ServerStorage](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/ServerStorage) | Assets that the server can access |
| `src/workspace` | [Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/class/Workspace) | Map models |

### Customizability

Gamebuilder is designed to allow integration with other libraries. The Get loader can be modified to fit your needs.

| Get call | Search Location | Functionality |
| - | - | - |
| `Get "Module"` | `src/common/Modules`, `src/common/Libraries` | Loads modules from common modules and libraries |
| `Get.Asset "Props/Asset"` | `src/common/Assets` | Gets assets from common storage |
| `Get.ServerAsset "Asset"` | `src/storage` | Gets a server asset (Server only) |
| `Get.Remote "Remote"` | `src/common/Remotes` | Gets a remote |
| `Get.Server "ServerModule"` | `src/server/ServerModules` | Gets a server module. Useful for server-only functionality, such as data management |
| `Get.MyMethod()` | Up to you! | Get can be configured in a way that suits your criteria |

## Get started

1. Clone this repository to your project folder.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/namatchi/gamebuilder <project name>
    ```

2. Remove this project's GitHub link.

    ```bash
    cd <project name>
    git remote rm origin
    ```

3. Make sure [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) is set up and added to your PATH.

4. Set up your project in dependencies in `default.project.json`

5. Build a place to open while editing.

    ```bash
    rojo build -o place.rbxlx
    ```

6. Serve your project.

    ```bash
    rojo serve
    ```

7. Activate Rojo in studio and begin coding!

## Configure to your needs

### Add source from external library to the Rojo tree:

To include a Rojo tree from another folder, add the directory to `default.project.json` with `$path` set to the correct destination. In this example, Roact is included.

*`default.project.json` has a space where external libraries should be added*

```json
"ReplicatedStorage": {
  "$className": "ReplicatedStorage",
  "$path": "src/common",
  "Libraries": {
    "$className": "Folder",

    "Roact": {
      "$path": "../roact/src"
    }

  }
}
```

```lua
-- ClientScript
local Get = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Get"))
local Roact = Get "Roact" -- Roact is loaded as if require(Roact) was called.

-- Modules can be used as normally.
local element = Roact.createElement(...)
```

### Customizing the Get loader

The Get loader can be customized to add extra functionality.

```lua
-- Get
ListenFor("Remote", Remotes, AssertExistence) -- Get.Remote

-- Use the built-in Get listener. Searches children in DogFolder.
ListenFor("Dog", DogFolder, function (result, name)
    assert(result ~= nil, "got no result for "..name)
    return result
end
    
-- Make a custom get function.
function Get.WithMyMethod(name)
    return Folder:FindFirstChild(name)
end
```

```lua
-- ClientScript
local Get = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"):WaitForChild("Get"))
local MyGet = Get.Dog "Perry"
local MyMethod = Get.WithMyMethod "Something"
```
